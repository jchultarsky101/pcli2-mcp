## [0.1.15] - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- Updated README: fix stale version reference (v0.1.11 → v0.1.15), consolidate features section, remove redundant "Enhanced Features" section.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- `pcli2_environment_use` tool → `pcli2 env use --name <name>`
- `pcli2_environment_add` tool → `pcli2 env add --name <name> [--api-url ...] [--ui-url ...] [--auth-url ...]`
- `pcli2_environment_remove` tool → `pcli2 env remove --name <name>`
- `pcli2_environment_reset` tool → `pcli2 env reset`
- `pcli2_user_list` tool → `pcli2 user list`
- `pcli2_user_get` tool → `pcli2 user get <user_id>`

### Changed

- Environment tools (`pcli2_environment_list` / `_get`) now invoke the canonical `pcli2 env ...` alias instead of `pcli2 environment ...`.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- **Breaking (MCP tool names):** Renamed `pcli2_config_environment_list` → `pcli2_environment_list` and `pcli2_config_environment_get` → `pcli2_environment_get` to match pcli2 v1.1.7, which promoted `environment` from a `config` subcommand to a top-level command.
- `pcli2` list tool: when `resource=asset`, `folder_path` is now required and `folder_uuid` is no longer accepted (reflects pcli2 v1.1.7 `asset list` signature). A new `recursive` option forwards `--recursive` to `asset list`.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-02-20

### Changed

- Disk-based cache at `~/.pcli2-mcp/thumbnails/` with configurable TTL (default 24 hours)
- HTML response for `pcli2_asset_thumbnail` with embedded image URL instead of base64 data

### Changed
